# IFC-TS Demo

An interactive React + TypeScript app for exploring **Information Flow Control (IFC)** using security lattices and labeled data flows.  
This demo lets you:

- Define lattices of security labels (e.g. *Low â‰¤ High*).  
- Create labeled data sources and compose flows with transformations and joins.  
- Define sinks with required labels and test writes against IFC rules.  
- Visualize flows, violations, and explanations using React Flow.
